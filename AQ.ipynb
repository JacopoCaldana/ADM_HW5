    "The algorithm systematically explores all possible simple paths from the source to the destination whose length does not exceed $k+1$ nodes. First, the graph is transformed into an adjacency list via $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList}$, ensuring that for every node, we know all its outgoing edges and the corresponding costs. During the depth-first search in $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesDFS}$, each recursive call only proceeds if the number of remaining stops is non-negative, thereby enforcing the constraint that no path longer than $k+1$ nodes (i.e., $k$ edges) is explored. Whenever the current node matches the destination, the minimum cost so far is updated if the current path’s cost is lower, so the global minimum for paths of acceptable length is eventually discovered. In addition, the algorithm temporarily includes the current node in the set of visited nodes to prevent revisiting the same node within one path, then removes it upon returning from the recursion, thereby considering only simple paths. This ensures no cycles inflate the cost or cause infinite recursion. Hence, by the time $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesDFS}$ completes, it has exhaustively checked all valid simple paths of length at most $k+1$ nodes and recorded the cheapest among them; if no such path exists, the function returns $\\infty$, causing the top-level $\\mathbf{findCheapestRouteDFS}$ to return $-1$. Thus, the algorithm correctly identifies either the minimal cost or the impossibility of reaching the destination under the specified constraints.\n"

    "### c) Analyze the algorithm's efficiency. Provide its time complexity and space complexity, and explain whether it is efficient for large graphs (e.g., n > 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "The main algorithm is $\\mathbf{findCheapestRouteDFS}$, whose complexity depends on the algorithms $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList}$ and $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesDFS}$. Let us analyze their contributions in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList}$ constructs the graph representation using an adjacency list. It initializes an empty list for each of the $n$ nodes, which takes $O(n)$, and iterates over all $m$ edges to populate the adjacency list, requiring $O(m)$. Therefore, the complexity of $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList}$ is $O(m + n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computationally intensive part is the algorithm $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesDFS}$, which performs a depth-first search (DFS) with a constraint on the maximum number of stops $k$. The algorithm explores all possible simple paths (i.e., crossing each node in the path exactly once) starting from $src$, and the maximum depth of the recursion is $k+1$ (corresponding to $k$ stops). Importantly, the algorithm does not only visit paths of length $k+1$ but also considers paths of smaller lengths when the condition $src == dst$ is satisfied before reaching the $k$-stop limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze its complexity, let us determine the number of recursive calls. At each level of recursion, the DFS explores all neighbors of the current node. Let $G=(V,E)$ be the graph built by $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList}$, where $n=|V|$ and $m=|E|$. In the worst case, the graph is complete, meaning there exists an edge between each pair of distinct nodes, resulting in $deg(u)=n-1 \\; \\forall u \\in V$ and $m = \\dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in the worst case, the algorithm analyzes all possible simple paths of length $k+1$ starting from the source node, with the condition $src == dst$ being satisfied only when the stops finish or never. Let us analyze the time complexity in the worst case. The first call inserts $src$ into $visitedNodes$ and generates $n-1$ calls. Each of these generates $n-2$ calls at the next level, which in turn generate $n-3$ calls, and so on, until the $(k+1)^{th}$ level. At this depth, the algorithm generates the final recursive calls, with the branching factor reduced to $n-k-1$. This occurs because $visitedNodes$ at each call contains the nodes previously visited for the specific path, avoiding revisits and ensuring the algorithm explores only simple paths of length at most $k+1$. When a recursive call ends, it removes the specific $src$ from $visitedNodes$, allowing backtracking. Thus, the number of recursive calls $T(n, k)$ can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "T(n,k) &= (n-1) + (n-1)(n-2) + (n-1)(n-2)(n-3) + \\dots + (n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k)(n-k-1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} \\prod_{j=0}^{i-1} (n-1-j)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify, we estimate an upper bound:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "The summation represents a geometric progression with ratio $(n-1)$. The closed form for this summation is:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "T(n,k) &\\leq \\dfrac{(n-1)^{k+2} - (n-1)}{n-2} \\approx (n-1)^{k+1}\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "T(n,k) \\in O((n-1)^{k+1}).\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall time complexity of $\\mathbf{findCheapestRouteDFS}$ is $O(m + (n-1)^{k+1})$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $(n-1)^{k+1}$ is the dominating term in the worst-case scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Compelxity Analysis\n",
    "When analyzing the space complexity of $\\mathbf{findCheapestRouteDFS}$, we take into account the adjacency list used to represent the graph, the recursive call stack, and the auxiliary data structures required during execution. The graph itself is stored using an adjacency list that requires $O(n + m)$ space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the space needed to store the input graph, the algorithm uses additional memory for the recursion and for tracking visited nodes in the current path. The recursive call stack can grow up to a depth of $k+1$ calls, where $k$ is the maximum number of stops allowed. Consequently, the worst-case space usage for the call stack is $O(k)$. In parallel, the set of visited nodes holds at most $k+1$ distinct vertices at any point, adding another $O(k)$ to the total auxiliary space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these factors, we see that the total space consumption can be expressed as $O(k) + O(k) + O(n + m)$, which simplifies to $O(k + n + m)$. Since in the worst case $k$ can be bounded by $n$, this further reduces to $O(n + m)$. Therefore, if we consider only the additional space used during the DFS (beyond the input), it is $O(k)$. However, when we include the adjacency list needed to store the graph, the overall space complexity is $O(n + m)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency for large graphs\n",
    "The efficiency of $\\mathbf{findCheapestRouteDFS}$ for large graphs is significantly influenced by the structure of the graph and the parameter $k$, which limits the maximum number of stops. While the adjacency list construction is efficient, taking $O(m + n)$, the depth-first search component introduces exponential growth due to the $(n-1)^{k+1}$ term in its time complexity.\\\n",
    "For sparse graphs, where the number of edges $m$ is close to $n$, and for small values of $k$, the algorithm can handle larger graphs effectively because the exponential term $(n-1)^{k+1}$ remains manageable. However, as $k$ increases, or if the graph is dense ($m \\approx n^2$), the number of paths the DFS must explore grows rapidly, making the algorithm impractical for large graphs.\\\n",
    "In summary, while the algorithm is suitable for small $k$ and sparse graphs, it is not efficient for large graphs with high connectivity or large $k$, as the exponential growth dominates the computational cost."

    "#### Correctness Analysis\n",
    "This approach relies on a dynamic-programming-like strategy to compute the minimum cost of reaching each vertex using up to $k+1$ edges. The array $minCostPerEdge[i][v]$ stores the minimal cost to reach vertex $v$ with exactly $i$ edges, and it is initialized to infinity for all $i$ and $v$, except for $minCostPerEdge[0][src]$ which is set to $0$. On each iteration from $1$ to $k+1$, the values of $minCostPerEdge[i]$ are first copied from $minCostPerEdge[i-1]$, which ensures that no vertex’s cost worsens from one step to the next. The algorithm then looks at each vertex $u$ for which $minCostPerEdge[i-1][u]$ is not infinity, and examines every edge $(u \\rightarrow v)$ with weight $weight$. If traveling from $src$ to $u$ with $i-1$ edges costs $minCostPerEdge[i-1][u]$ and then continuing to $v$ adds $weight$, the new total cost $newCost$ is compared to the current $minCostPerEdge[i][v]$. If $newCost$ is smaller, $minCostPerEdge[i][v]$ is updated. By the end of these $k+1$ rounds, $minCostPerEdge[i][v]$ will hold the lowest possible cost from $src$ to $v$ with at most $i$ edges. The minimum across all $i \\in [0, k+1]$ for the destination $dst$ thus reflects the true minimal cost to get from $src$ to $dst$ with at most $k+1$ edges. If no cost was ever improved from infinity, then it follows that no valid path with at most $k$ edges (or $k+1$ nodes) exists, and $\\infty$ is returned. Hence the algorithm correctly finds the cheapest cost under the given edge constraint, or deduces that no such route is possible.\n",

    "#### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "The function $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList(flights, n)}$ is the same as previously discussed, used for building the adjacency list representation of the graph. Its time complexity is $O(m+n)$, where $m$ is the number of edges and $n$ is the number of nodes. The overall time complexity of the $\\mathbf{findCheapestRoutePol}$ algorithm is determined by the combination of $\\mathbf{createAdjacencyList}$ and $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$.\n",

    "Analyzing the $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$ function in detail, we first compute the number of nodes, which takes $O(n)$. Then, initializing the matrix $minCostPerEdge$ to represent the minimum cost for each node and edge count requires $O(n \\cdot k)$, since the matrix has dimensions $(k+2) \\times n$. Setting $minCostPerEdge[0][src]$ to zero is a single operation and takes $O(1)$.\n",

For each iteration, the previous row of the matrix is copied to the current row, which takes $O(n)$. Inside this loop, we iterate over all nodes, amounting to $O(n)$ operations for the middle loop. For each node, we then iterate over its neighbors, and in the worst case, where the graph is complete, each node has up to $n-1$ neighbors. Thus, the inner-most loop processes all neighbors and, when combined with the middle loop, results in $O(n^2)$ operations for each iteration of the outer loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can analyze the inner loops differently by considering that they process all edges of the graph in the worst case. Since the graph has $m$ edges, the cost of processing edges in the inner-most loop is $O(m)$ for each iteration of the outer loop. Combining this with the $O(n)$ cost of the middle loop and $O(k)$ iterations of the outer loop, we get:\n",

    "T(n, k) = O(k) \\cdot (O(n) + O(m)) = O(k \\cdot (n + m)).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "After the nested loops complete, the algorithm computes the minimum cost among all valid edge counts from $0$ to $k+1$. This requires iterating over $k+2$ values and takes $O(k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all these components, the total time complexity of $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$ is $O(k \\cdot n^2)$ when expressed purely in terms of $n$, or equivalently $O(k \\cdot (n + m))$ when considering both $n$ and $m$. As $O(k \\cdot n^2)$ dominates, it determines the overall time complexity of the $\\mathbf{findCheapestRoutePol}$ algorithm, exceeding the $O(m+n)$ complexity of creating the adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "The space complexity of the algorithm is primarily determined by the $minCostPerEdge$ matrix, which has dimensions $(k+2) \\times n$. Thus, the space complexity is $O(k \\cdot n)$. No additional significant memory is used apart from a few variables for computation, making the space usage manageable for most practical cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Efficiency for large graphs\n",
    "The $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$ algorithm is significantly more efficient in terms of time complexity compared to the DFS-based algorithm used previously. The DFS-based approach explores all possible paths with up to $k+1$ nodes, leading to an exponential time complexity of $O((n-1)^{k+1})$ in the worst case, as it examines a vast number of potential combinations of nodes. In contrast, $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$ employs a dynamic programming approach with a time complexity of $O(k \\cdot n^2)$ or equivalently $O(k \\cdot (n + m))$. This improvement is substantial, particularly for large graphs where $n$ and $m$ are significant. The quadratic dependency on $n$ ensures that the algorithm scales better, even for large $k$, making it far more practical for real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of memory usage, the DFS-based algorithm is more efficient. The DFS approach requires $O(k)$ space for the recursive stack and the visited set. On the other hand, $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$ uses $O(k \\cdot n)$ space to store the dynamic programming matrix $minCostPerEdge$, which grows linearly with both $k$ and $n$. While this increased memory usage might appear to be a disadvantage, the trade-off is worthwhile in this context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In computational problems like these, reducing the time complexity is often far more critical than minimizing memory usage. A faster algorithm enables the solution of larger and more complex instances within a reasonable time frame, which is essential for practical applications. While memory efficiency is important, modern computational systems generally have sufficient memory to handle the $O(k \\cdot n)$ requirement of this algorithm, especially when $k$ and $n$ are not excessively large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the $\\mathbf{minCostWithMaxKEdgesPol}$ algorithm strikes a better balance between time and space efficiency, making it a superior choice for solving this problem, especially for large graphs or higher values of $k$. Sacrificing a modest increase in memory for a dramatic improvement in runtime is the more practical trade-off in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Implementation\n",
    "We have implemented the `find_cheapest_route_pol` function, which invokes `create_adjacency_list` and the dynamic-programming-based routine `min_cost_with_max_K_edges_pol`, in the `functions.py` module. We used the same test cases as before, and the function produced the same correct results, confirming its validity. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to `functions.py`, where the code is enriched with extensive comments."

    "#### Correctness Analysis\n",
    "The algorithm is correct because it processes states in increasing order of total cost, ensuring that when a state with the destination node is finally extracted from the priority queue, the corresponding cost is indeed minimal among all paths that use at most $k+1$ flights. It starts by pushing into the queue a single state with cost 0, node equal to the source, 0 stops, and a visited set containing only the source. By always extracting the state with the smallest cost first, it imitates Dijkstra’s logic, but it also keeps a set of visited nodes to forbid revisiting them in the same path and a stops counter that cannot exceed $k+1$. This means that each simple path of length up to $k+1$ flights is eventually considered in strictly increasing order of cost. If a state with node equal to the destination is popped, that state’s cost must be minimal among all valid paths; if such a state never appears, it implies that no valid path exists, and the algorithm returns -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "ChatGPT claimed that each node would appear in the priority queue at most $k+1$ times, leading to $O(n \\cdot k)$ total entries and a cost of $O(\\log(n \\cdot k))$ per extract-min operation, which would imply a time complexity of $O(m \\cdot \\log(n \\cdot k))$. However, this analysis overlooks the fact that the code stores the entire set of visited nodes in each state. This means that the same node can be inserted multiple times with different subsets of visited nodes, and these subsets can be numerous when $k$ is not very small. Indeed, each path can include up to $k+1$ distinct nodes, and a node can appear in the priority queue along with any of the subsets of already visited nodes. In the worst-case scenario, the number of such subsets can be on the order of $n^{k+1}$, as each of the $k+1$ nodes in the path can be chosen from $n$ possibilities, creating a combinatorial explosion. Once we acknowledge that the algorithm might enqueue on the order of $n^{k+1}$ states, the extract-min step on the priority queue, costing $O(\\log(n^{k+1}))$, turns into \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "O\\bigl(n^{k+1} \\cdot \\log(n^{k+1})\\bigr),\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "and since $\\log(n^{k+1}) = (k+1)\\log(n)$, this simplifies to \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "O\\bigl(n^{k+1} \\cdot k \\log n\\bigr).\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Therefore, the actual worst-case time complexity of the code is exponential in $k$, rather than the more modest $O(m \\cdot \\log(n \\cdot k))$ described by ChatGPT. This exponential behavior stems from the large number of potential visited-subset configurations that can appear in the priority queue, invalidating ChatGPT’s claim that the total enqueues would be limited to just one state per node per stop-count.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison with Our Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our original algorithm employs a dynamic programming strategy, where we iteratively compute the minimum cost to reach each node with up to $k+1$ edges. The DP table is updated in each iteration based on the costs from the previous step, ensuring that we consider all possible paths within the stop constraint without revisiting nodes in the same path.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's Dijkstra-like approach was initially described as having a time complexity of $O(m \\cdot \\log(n \\cdot k))$, where $m$ is the number of flights and $n$ is the number of nodes. This suggests that the algorithm scales efficiently with the number of flights and nodes, especially when $k$ is relatively small. However, this analysis does not account for the additional complexity introduced by tracking the set of visited nodes within each state. By maintaining these visited sets, the number of possible states that the algorithm must process can grow exponentially with respect to $k$. Specifically, in the worst case, the number of states can reach $O(n^{k+1})$, leading to a time complexity of $O(n^{k+1} \\cdot k \\cdot \\log n)$. This exponential growth makes ChatGPT's approach impractical for larger values of $k$, as the computation time becomes prohibitively large. In contrast, our dynamic programming approach operates with a time complexity of $O(k \\cdot n^2)$, which scales linearly with both the number of allowed stops and the number of flights. This linear relationship ensures that our algorithm remains efficient even as the size of the graph and the value of $k$ increase. By avoiding the need to track visited node sets and instead iteratively building up the minimum costs, our approach circumvents the combinatorial explosion inherent in ChatGPT's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both ChatGPT's approach and our dynamic programming method correctly identify the minimum cost path within the specified number of stops. ChatGPT's algorithm ensures correctness by processing nodes in order of increasing cost and adhering to the stop constraint. However, the inefficiency introduced by tracking visited sets compromises its practicality for larger problems. Our dynamic programming approach guarantees correctness by systematically updating the minimum costs for each node across all permissible numbers of stops, ensuring that the optimal path is found without unnecessary computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while ChatGPT's optimized Dijkstra-like algorithm maintains correctness in finding the cheapest route within the stop constraint, its exponential time complexity relative to $k$ renders it inefficient for larger values of $k$. Our dynamic programming approach, with its linear time complexity concerning both $k$ and the number of flights, offers a more scalable and practical solution. This makes our method better suited for handling extensive graphs and higher stop constraints, ensuring both efficiency and accuracy in diverse scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Implementation\n",
    "We have implemented the `find_cheapest_route_Dijkstra` function in Python, which is located within the `functions.py` module. This function leverages the helper functions `create_adjacency_list` for constructing the graph's adjacency list and `min_cost_with_max_K_edges_Dijkstra` for computing the minimum cost route with the specified number of stops. To ensure the reliability and correctness of our implementation, we tested `find_cheapest_route_Dijkstra` using the same test cases previously described. The results consistently matched the expected outcomes, confirming that the algorithm performs as intended.
